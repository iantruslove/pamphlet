# Pamphlet

A static web site generator.

## Rationale

Static websites are neat, but static website generators are harder
than they have to be. [Jekyll][] is pretty great, but unfortunately it
mixes content, theme and code all into one source tree.

Clojure is pretty great, and there aren't -- IMHO -- any static
blogging tools as good as Jekyll written in Clojure, and thus Pamphlet
is an attempt to solve the former problem with the latter tool.

My ideal for Pamphlet is few installation prerequisites (a JVM and
maybe Leiningen or Boot), and very clear separation of authored site
content from theme and total separation of these from the site
generation tooling.

## History

Pamphlet is a direct fork of [Static][], and takes some inspiration
and code from [Terhechte's Fork][Terhechte] of static.

## Pamphlet?

Anyone can make a pamphlet. Neighborhood Watch groups make
pamphlets. Marx's Communist Manifesto was published as a pamphlet.
Pamphlets are an accessible, powerful means of self-publication.
